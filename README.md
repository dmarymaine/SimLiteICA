# SimLiteICA
Python S/W to simulate frequency maps of a given CMB polarisation experiment (here is LiteBird as a banch) where to include different systematic effects.
Then it runs FastICA component separation algorithm to extract the CMB component and to evaluate the residual systematc effects in the CMB signal.

In order to run the code you need to have:
  * HEALPix
  * healpy
  * numpy
  * matplotlib

It is a pure python code.
